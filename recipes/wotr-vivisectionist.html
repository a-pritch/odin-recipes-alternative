        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The following is my build for an alchemist (Vivisectionist) in Wrath of the Righteous</p>
        <p>It has the advantage of having many sources of added AC, making it a good tank. Damage is not also alright despite it being a frontliner, and it also can share its spells with the party.</p>
        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>Take the following skills:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mobility</li>
            <li>Perception</li>
            <li>Knowledge - Arcana</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Build Order</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Vivisectionist (1)</li>
            <li>Monk (1)</li>
            <li>Rogue (3)</li>
